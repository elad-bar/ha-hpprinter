## Troubleshooting

Before opening an issue, please provide logs and diagnostic file data related to the issue.

### Logs

For debug log level, please add the following to your config.yaml

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.hpprinter: debug
```

Or use the HA capability in device page:

1. Settings
2. Devices & Services
3. HP Printer
4. 3 dots menu
5. Enable debug logging

When done and would like to extract the log, repeat steps, in step #5 - Disable debug logging

### Diagnostic details

Please attach also diagnostic details of the integration, available in:

1. Settings
2. Devices & Services
3. HP Printer
4. 3 dots menu
5. Download diagnostics

Diagnostic file contains 3 section related to data extracted from the device:

- data.debug.rawData - Raw data extracted from all endpoints of the device, from that source you can extract ideas for additional entities to suggest
- data.debug.devicesConfig - Configuration of mapping to convert data from HP Printer EWS to HA devices and entities, that will be the section that new entities will be added
- data.debug.devicesData - Data extracted for HA entities, just relevant data points, according to mapped objects available in section `data.debug.devicesConfig`

## Translations

Integration translated from English to:

- German
- Danish
